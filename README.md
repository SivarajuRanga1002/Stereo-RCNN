# Stereo-RCNN
Implementation of Stereo-RCNN based 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving

Main code is in the master branch.

For implementing Stereo-RCNN we could not find the same data files as mentioned in the official Git repo of Stereo RCNN for 3d Object Detection for Autonomous Driving from HKUST Aerial Robotics Group!
Downloaded KITTI dataset from other sources and implemented the STEREO-RCNN with CUDA 9

Thank you!
